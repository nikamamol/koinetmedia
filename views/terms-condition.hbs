        <p>The Agreement also governs the use of the www.KOINET MEDIA.com website (and all other KOINET MEDIA-branded websites) (“KOINET MEDIA Websites”) and all of the services, information and other offerings available at KOINET MEDIA Websites (taken together, the “System”). The System is owned and operated by KOINET MEDIA. The System is offered subject to Your acceptance, without modification, of all of the terms and conditions contained herein and all other operating rules, policies and procedures (collectively, the “Agreement”) that may be published from time to time on KOINET MEDIA Websites.</p>
        <p class="fw-bold">BY REGISTERING AS AN ADVERTISER BY SIGNING AN ORDER, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THIS AGREEMENT. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO ALL OF THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS CONTAINED IN THIS AGREEMENT, THEN DO NOT REGISTER AS AN ADVERTISER OR SIGN AN ORDER.</p>
        <p>KOINET MEDIA may refuse to allow any person or entity to register for the System and may change its eligibility criteria, at any time, in its sole discretion.</p>
        <ol>
            <li class="fs-3 fw-bold">Use of the System:</li>
            <p> During the term of this Agreement, with terms specified in Your Order and subject to Your compliance with all the terms and conditions hereof, You are authorized to access the System solely to place Orders for Data and Leads and manage Your KOINET MEDIA Advertiser account(s) (each, an “Account”). Your Orders may be placed in the System; and KOINET MEDIA will fill Your Order using our Marketing Campaign(s) (“Campaign(s)”) subject to Data and Lead availability. You represent, warrant and covenant that all information You provide, whether on behalf of Yourself or other third parties, for the purpose of enrolling as an Advertiser (i.e., creating an Account) will be, to the best of Your knowledge, accurate, complete and current at all times and that, in the case of third-party information You provide, that You are duly authorized by such third parties to provide such information. You further represent and covenant that Advertiser will not distribute or re-sell to any third party any Data or Lead provided to You by KOINET MEDIA through the System.  Furthermore, Advertiser will use any Data or Lead provided to You by KOINET MEDIA solely for the solicitation and sale, by You, directly to an end-user business, of those products or services either as requested by them and/or as represented in Orders You have placed in the System.</p>

            <li class="fs-3 fw-bold">Data and Lead Verification, Delivery and Contact Information:-</li>
            <p>Data or Leads provided by KOINET MEDIA through the System will contain the following information: name, company, job title, level, function, company size, industry classification, address, state, phone number, and e-mail address in addition to specific information related to the Order. In some cases, company website address and LinkedIn URL for the contact will be provided but this is not guaranteed. Each SalesConnect Lead provided to Advertiser will be exclusive meaning the Lead will not be submitted within six (6) months before or after the time of delivery to any other company that provides the same Solution as the Advertiser.</p>
            <p>Each Data or Lead will meet the parametric requirements as specified by the Order. In addition, each Lead will be qualified as to 1) their involvement in making a decision for the Solution offered by the Advertiser, 2) their willingness to talk to an Advertiser representative and 3) having a purchase evaluation within a 12-month timeframe.</p>
            <p>KOINET MEDIA’s guarantee of Data or Lead delivery is limited to posting of Leads to Your Account. You will be provided online access to Your Account within five (5) business days of submitting Your Order. It is Your responsibility to ensure that You are able to log into Your Account to monitor the receipt of Data or Leads. KOINET MEDIA is not responsible for any failure to receive completed Data or Leads via email due to spam filters, address-book filters, filters imposed by internet service providers, or failure on the part of Advertiser’s email servers or internet service provider to deliver the Leads.  During the course of an active Campaign, Data or Lead delivery cannot be paused for any reason nor can there be a limit set on the number of Leads delivered per day. In situations where Advertiser has opted for KOINET MEDIA’s direct post service (“Direct Post”), KOINET MEDIA is not responsible for any failure to receive a Lead posted to Advertiser’s CRM or MAP system. You agree that the delivery of Data or Leads to Your Account shall be deemed to be proof of usage of our Services irrespective of whether or not You pursue a Lead. Advertiser shall contact each Lead using the information provided on the applicable Form. Each Form will only be used for such purposes.</p>
            <p>You agree to keep Your Account and Your payment information (such as a change in billing contact, address) current, complete and accurate or let us know immediately if You become aware of a potential breach of security (with respect to Your Account or relevant payment information), such as the unauthorized disclosure or use of Your username or password.</p>
            <li class="fs-3 fw-bold">Restrictions:</li>
            <p>You shall not (either directly or indirectly):</p>
            <p>(i) decipher, decompile, disassemble, reverse engineer, or otherwise attempt to derive any source code or underlying ideas or algorithms from any part of the System, except to the limited extent applicable laws specifically prohibit such restriction,</p>
            <p>(ii) modify, translate, or otherwise create derivative works of any part of the System, or</p>
            <p>(iii) copy, rent, lease, distribute, or otherwise transfer any of the rights that You receive here under.</p>
            <p>Your right to access Your Account (including, without limitation, any login or other access information) is personal to You, is non-transferable and non-assignable, and is subject to any limits established by KOINET MEDIA. You agree that You will not use any automated means, including, without limitation, agents, robots, scripts, or spiders, to access or manage Your Account with KOINET MEDIA or to monitor or copy the KOINET MEDIA Websites or the content contained therein except those automated means, if any, either expressly made available by KOINET MEDIA or authorized in advance and in writing by KOINET MEDIA. You agree that You will not interfere or attempt to interfere with the proper working of the KOINET MEDIA Websites or the System. Without limitation to the foregoing, You further agree that You will not take any action that imposes an unreasonable or disproportionately large load, as determined by KOINET MEDIA, on the KOINET MEDIA Websites, the System, or KOINET MEDIA’s infrastructure.</p>
            <li class="fs-3 fw-bold">Budget, Payments and Billing:</li>
            <p> You agree to pay KOINET MEDIA for all charges to Your Account, in accordance with this Agreement and the KOINET MEDIA payment plan (“Payment Plan”). Billing will be monthly for Data or Leads delivered and payments are due upon receipt and considered late if not paid within 30 days from receipt of invoice. Advertiser can set either a Monthly, Quarterly or Pilot campaign Budget. A Monthly Budget is set on a calendar month basis and is not based on either the date when the Account was initially setup or when the Agreement was signed. KOINET MEDIA guarantees that it will not exceed the Monthly Budget as specified in the Order, but cannot guarantee that it will always deliver Leads to meet the Monthly Budget. A Quarterly Budget is set for a specified 3-month period. KOINET MEDIA guarantees that it will not exceed the Quarterly Budget as specified in the Order, but cannot guarantee that it will always deliver Leads to meet the Quarterly Budget. A Pilot Budget is set for a specified dollar amount and not a specific time period. KOINET MEDIA guarantees that it will not exceed the Pilot Budget as specified in the Order, but cannot guarantee that it will always deliver Leads to meet the Pilot Budget. Quarterly or Pilot campaign budgets cannot be cancelled or changed. Changes to, and/or cancellations of, Monthly Budget campaigns requires a 60-day written notice.</p>
            <p>You are only charged for Data or Leads that are actually delivered minus any approved credits (“Credit(s)”). You agree that KOINET MEDIA has the right to assign its accounts receivable monies payable under the Payment Plan to a third-party financing company to whom any and all payments, including electronic payments of any kind, must be made. You will receive advance notification of such assignment. As You become indebted to KOINET MEDIA (when invoiced), any and all payments, including electronic payments of any kind, will be made payable to the applicable third-party company. If payment is not received within thirty (30) days, then KOINET MEDIA has the right to hold the delivery of Data or Leads until payment is made. Data or Leads will continue to accumulate in our System but only be delivered when payment is received.</p>
            <p>You must submit any claims or disputes You may have with respect to any charge made to Your Account in writing to KOINET MEDIA within thirty (30) days of such charge, otherwise such claim or dispute will be waived, and such charge will be final and not subject to challenge. If Credits have been applied in return for Your opening of an Account, KOINET MEDIA reserves the right to terminate such Credits at any time. All returns of Data or Leads shall be for Credit only, not a refund. To be considered for Credit, requests for returns must be submitted within five (5) business days of the Lead being posted to Your Account. Data or Leads return requests must be submitted from the “Credits” section of Your Account on the KOINET MEDIA Website. Such requests must contain a reason for the refund.</p>
            <p class="fw-bold">Acceptable reasons for returns related to either the DataConnect and MarketingConnect program include:</p>
            <p>(a)the email address is not valid.</p>
            <p>(b) the Data or Lead is a duplicate containing identical contact information to another Data or Lead received from KOINET MEDIA in the last six (6) months.</p>
            <p>(c) the Data or Lead doesn’t match the firmographic information specified in Order.</p>
            <p>Acceptable reasons for returns related to the SalesConnect program include:</p>
            <p>(a) the contact information, such as the phone number, provided in the Lead Form proves to be inaccurate enough to cause the Advertiser to be unable to contact the Lead.</p>
            <p>(b) the Lead is a duplicate containing identical contact information to another Lead received from KOINET MEDIA in the last six (6) months.</p>
            <p>(c)the request to receive information and/or talk to Advertiser’s representative was not made by the individual whose contact information was provided in the Lead Form.</p>
            <p>(d) the Lead is for a company name that is a publicly recognized competitor of the Advertiser.</p>
            <p>Advertiser will be notified concerning the approval (or denial) of their Data or Lead return requests via email within ten (10) business days. All Credits resulting from approved Data or Lead return requests can be viewed in the “Credits” section of Your Account on the KOINET MEDIA Website.</p>
            <li class="fs-3 fw-bold">Confidentiality:</li>
            <p>During the term of this Agreement, each party (a “Disclosing Party”) may provide the other party (a “Receiving Party”) with confidential and/or proprietary materials and information (“Confidential Information”). All materials and information provided by Disclosing Party to Receiving Party and identified at the time of disclosure as “Confidential” or bearing a similar legend, and all other information that the Receiving Party reasonably should have known was the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party, shall be considered Confidential Information. Receiving Party shall maintain the confidentiality of the Confidential Information and will not disclose such information to any third party without the prior written consent of Disclosing Party. Receiving Party will only use the Confidential Information internally for the purposes contemplated here under.</p>
            <p class="fw-bold">The obligations in this Section 5 shall not apply to any information that:</p>
            <p>(i)  is made generally available to the public without breach of this Agreement,</p>
            <p>(ii) is developed by the Receiving Party independently from the Confidential Information,</p>
            <p>(iii) is disclosed to Receiving Party by a third party without restriction, or</p>
            <p>(iv)  was in the Receiving Party’s lawful possession prior to the disclosure and was not obtained by the Receiving Party, either directly or indirectly, from the Disclosing Party. Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information as required by law or court order; provided that, Receiving Party provides Disclosing Party with prompt written notice thereof and uses its best efforts to limit disclosure. At any time, upon Disclosing Party’s request, Receiving Party shall return to Disclosing Party all Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information in its possession, including, without limitation, all copies and extracts thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information to any third-party to the limited extent necessary to exercise its rights, or perform its obligations, under this Agreement; provided that all such third parties are bound in writing by obligations of confidentiality and non-use at least as protective of the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information as provided for in this Agreement.</p>
            <p>The information that You supply to establish and maintain Your Account, whether on behalf of Yourself or on behalf of a third party, shall be Your Confidential Information, and You agree that KOINET MEDIA may, but is not obligated to, provide Your email address(es) and basic Advertiser Account detail (including but not limited to Your postal address, phone number, and fax number) to Marketing Partners. However, KOINET MEDIA will not disclose, to any third-party, information that KOINET MEDIA receives from You regarding the quality or performance of Data or Leads obtained by You through the System, except as aggregated and anonymized data for quality control and evaluation purposes. The parties to this Agreement acknowledge that the harm caused by the wrongful disclosure of Confidential Information will be difficult, if not impossible, to assess on a monetary basis alone, and that legal damages may not be sufficient compensation for such wrongful disclosure. Therefore, either party may enforce its rights under this Section by equitable means, including, but not limited to, injunctive relief, in addition to any other remedies to which it is otherwise entitled.</p>
            <li class="fs-3 fw-bold">Representations and Warranties:</li>
